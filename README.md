# Coastal Marsh Acoustic Monitoring Analysis
Welcome to the Coastal Marsh Acoustic Monitoring project repository!  

This repository contains open-source R Markdown scripts and supporting code for analyzing acoustic monitoring data collected from marshes along the **Delaware and Barnegat Bays**. The primary goal of this project is to understand how birds respond to changes in marsh habitat, particularly those changes that result from restoration practices.

## Purpose

By analyzing daily and seasonal patterns in acoustic indices and species presence, this project aims to:

- Evaluate how marsh restoration influences the acoustic environment.
- Provide a framework for analyzing passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data in coastal wetland habitats.
- Make this analysis pipeline **open source** and adaptable for other bioacousticians and conservation scientists.

## Project Collaboration

This project was a **collaboration between the USFWS Coastal Program and Rutgers University**.  
- **Rutgers University involvement** was led by **Kelly Faller** as part of her **Master’s thesis**. She conducted the data management, analysis, and report generation.  
- The **USFWS Coastal Program** provided equipment, field time, project management, and other crucial support to make the acoustic monitoring of marsh restoration possible.

## 📁 Project Resources and Folder Structure

This repository is organized to keep your data and scripts well structured for reproducibility and easy navigation:

Here are some highlights of the repository:
- **Main Analysis**: `02-Acoustics-Analysis.Rmd`  
- **BirdNET Appendix**: `03-BirdNET-Analysis.Rmd`  
- **Data Inputs**: CSV and shapefiles (not included in the repository, but scripts are set up to process them).
- **Outputs**: Summary tables and plots exploring daily acoustic complexity, biodiversity, anthropogenic disturbance, and species presence.

### 🗺️ Navigating the Repository

- **01 - Data Prep Scripts**: Start here to clean and process your raw data.
- **02 - Analysis Scripts**: Core analysis using acoustic indices, pattern matching data (from Arbimon), and visualization scripts. This folder includes an appendix used specifically for BirdNET outputs.
- **Audio**: Audio recordings for use in HTML outputs. Not for analysis, but for analysis description.
- **Data**: CSV and shapefiles (not included here, but referenced in scripts).
- **Docs**: Documentation, including the [`CITATION.cff`](./Docs/CITATION.cff) file and this README, as well as important methodological documents such as the acoustic monitoring manual.
- **Images**: Store field images for presentation or sharing. These images are used within the RMD.
- **Metadata**: Reference data on sites, stations, and deployments.
- **Outputs**: Final summary tables and figures generated by analysis scripts.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> These data and scripts are **preliminary** and subject to updates. BirdNET-based analyses require **manual verification**, especially for rare species detections.]

## Explore the Results

The data used in these analysis scripts were **downloaded using the backup feature on the Arbimon platform**, and all species presence data was derived from extensive pattern matching analyses performed in Arbimon. This link leads to my **project insights** page, showcasing the results and data visualizations generated through Arbimon’s analytical tools.

> [!NOTE]
If you’re interested in **how these results were achieved**—or want to learn more about the various analytical features in Arbimon—I’d be more than happy to discuss the process. Feel free to **reach out to me** with questions or collaboration ideas!

## Why Open Source?

I hope that by sharing this code on GitHub, other researchers and practitioners can:

✅ Use these scripts as a starting point for their own projects.  
✅ Adapt the visualizations and metrics for different sites and monitoring goals.  
✅ Contribute back improvements or adaptations to build a stronger community of practice.

I am happy for others to adapt and use this code—**as long as credit is given**.

##  Citation

If you use or adapt these scripts for your own work, please cite them as described in the included [`CITATION.cff`](CITATION.cff) file also found in the "Docs" folder.
