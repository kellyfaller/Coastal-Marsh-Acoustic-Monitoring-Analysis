# Coastal Marsh Acoustic Monitoring

Welcome to my research landing page! This site highlights ongoing work to understand how birds respond to changes in marsh habitat, especially in the **Delaware and Barnegat Bays**. Here you‚Äôll find:

- Project goals and methods
- Analysis scripts and supporting materials
- Visuals and updates on this important work

---

> **IMPORTANT:** These data and scripts are **preliminary** and subject to updates. BirdNET-based analyses require **manual verification**, especially for rare species detections.

---

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Evaluate how marsh restoration influences the acoustic environment.
- Provide a reproducible framework for analyzing **passive acoustic monitoring (PAM)** data in tidal wetland habitats.
- Make this analysis pipeline **open source** and adaptable for other bioacousticians and conservation scientists.

---

## Project Collaboration

This project was a **collaboration between the USFWS Coastal Program and Rutgers University**, with invaluable support from Danielle McCulloch (USFWS).

- **Rutgers University involvement**: Led by **Kelly Faller** as part of her **Master‚Äôs thesis**. Kelly conducted the data management, analysis, and report generation.
- The **USFWS Coastal Program** provided equipment, field time, project management, and other crucial support to make the acoustic monitoring of marsh restoration possible.

## üìÅ Repository Overview

The repository that supports this project includes:

- **Main Analysis**: Scripts in `02-Acoustics-Analysis.Rmd`  
- **BirdNET Appendix**: Scripts in `03-BirdNET-Analysis.Rmd`  
- **Data Inputs**: CSV and shapefiles (not included in the repository but referenced in scripts).
- **Outputs**: Summary tables and plots exploring daily acoustic complexity, biodiversity, anthropogenic disturbance, and species presence.

## Explore the Results

The data used in these analysis scripts were **downloaded using the backup feature on the Arbimon platform**, and all species presence data was derived from extensive pattern matching analyses performed in Arbimon.

## Why Open Source?

I hope that by sharing this code on GitHub, other researchers and practitioners can:

‚úÖ Use these scripts as a starting point for their own projects.  
‚úÖ Adapt the visualizations and metrics for different sites and monitoring goals.  
‚úÖ Contribute improvements or adaptations to strengthen the community of practice.

If you‚Äôd like to support my work or adaptations, please visit the **‚ÄúSponsor this Project‚Äù** banner on the repository page!
