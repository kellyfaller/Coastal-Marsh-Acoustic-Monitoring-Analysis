Welcome to my research landing page! This site highlights ongoing work to understand how birds respond to restoration in marsh habitat at two sites in the Barnegat Bay, **Cattus Island and the Lighthouse Center for Natural Resource Education**. On this page, you‚Äôll find information about:

- Project goals and methods
- Visuals and project updates
- Contact information for collaboration

Please visit my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kellyfaller/Coastal-Marsh-Acoustic-Monitoring-Analysis) for open-sourced code and tools to aid in your own research in bioacoustics.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Evaluate how marsh restoration influences the acoustic environment.
- Provide a reproducible framework for analyzing **passive acoustic monitoring (PAM)** data in tidal wetland habitats.
- Make this analysis pipeline **open source** and adaptable for other bioacousticians and conservation scientists.

---

## Project Collaboration
This project was a **collaboration between the USFWS Coastal Program and Rutgers University**, with invaluable support from Danielle McCulloch (USFWS).

- **Rutgers University involvement**: Led by **Kelly Faller** as part of her **Master‚Äôs thesis**. Kelly conducted the data management, analysis, and report generation.
- The **USFWS Coastal Program** provided equipment, field time, project management, and other crucial support.

## Project Timeline
<ul class="timeline">
  <li><strong>2024</strong>: Initial deployments at Cattus Island and the Lighthouse Center. Recordings from late June to late September. Proof-of-concept year with collaboration building.</li>
  <li><strong>2025</strong>: Expanded monitoring during breeding season. Acoustic recorders deployed early June. <a href="https://www.tidalmarshbirds.org/index.php/publicly-availablr-products/products/vegatation-sampling-protocols/marsh-survey-protocols/221-sharp-callbacksurvey-protocol-2025/file">SHARP protocols</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>2026</strong>: Continued monitoring and data analysis. Restoration activities in early 2026; preliminary findings shared later.</li>
  <li><strong>2027</strong>: Continued data analysis and thesis defense alongside ongoing monitoring.</li>
  <li><strong>2028 and beyond</strong>: Ongoing post-restoration monitoring for success metrics.</li>

## Field Photos

Here‚Äôs a snapshot of our fieldwork:

## Explore the Marsh
<!-- Add info about the marsh/what it needs for restoration/what restoration is happening and why, audio samples, or field notes here -->

Want to know what a soundscape of the marsh sounds like? Below is an audio file recorded in a salt marsh along the Delaware Bay in early May 2023. The recording is from roughly 8 PM. What you'll experience is a typical spring dusk chorus. Birds exhibit heightened periods of singing activity at dawn and dusk. The reason why is actually something that science has not quite figured out yet. There are many hypotheses for why. You can hear more about that here: [The Field Guides Podcast: Ep. 73 The Dawn Chorus (Part 1)](https://www.thefieldguidespodcast.com/new-blog/2024/8/24/ep-67-fishers-in-the-field-a-hike-with-carnivore-researcher-dr-scott-lapoint-cjfme-5z8gz-em7y6-w4f4x)

## Explore the Results
The data used in these analyses were **downloaded using the backup feature on the Arbimon platform**, and all species presence data was derived from extensive pattern matching analyses in Arbimon.
