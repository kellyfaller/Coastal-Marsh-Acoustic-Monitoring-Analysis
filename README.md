# Soundscape-Analysis-Rare-Bird-Detection
This repository contains R Markdown scripts and supporting code for analyzing acoustic monitoring data collected from marshes along the **Delaware and Barnegat Bays**. The primary goal of this project is to understand how birds respond to changes in marsh habitat, particularly those changes that result from restoration practices.

## 🔍 Purpose

By analyzing daily and seasonal patterns in acoustic indices and species presence, this project aims to:

- Evaluate how marsh restoration influences the acoustic environment.
- Provide a framework for analyzing passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data in coastal wetland habitats.
- Make this analysis pipeline **open source** and adaptable for other bioacousticians and conservation scientists.

## 🌿 Why Open Source?

I hope that by sharing this code on GitHub, other researchers and practitioners can:

✅ Use these scripts as a starting point for their own projects.  
✅ Adapt the visualizations and metrics for different sites and monitoring goals.  
✅ Contribute back improvements or adaptations to build a stronger community of practice.

I am happy for others to adapt and use this code—**as long as credit is given**.
