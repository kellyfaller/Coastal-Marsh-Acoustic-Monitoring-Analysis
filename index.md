Welcome to my research landing page! This site highlights ongoing work to understand how birds respond to restoration in marsh habitat at two sites in the Barnegat Bay, **Cattus Island and the Lighthouse Center for Natural Resource Education**. On this page, you’ll find information about:

- Project goals and methods
- Visuals and project updates
- Contact information for collaboration

Please visit my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kellyfaller/Coastal-Marsh-Acoustic-Monitoring-Analysis) for open-sourced code and tools to aid in your own research in bioacoustics.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Evaluate how marsh restoration influences the acoustic environment.
- Provide a reproducible framework for analyzing **passive acoustic monitoring (PAM)** data in tidal wetland habitats.
- Make this analysis pipeline **open source** and adaptable for other bioacousticians and conservation scientists.

---

## Project Collaboration
This project was a **collaboration between the USFWS Coastal Program and Rutgers University**, with invaluable support from Danielle McCulloch (USFWS).

- **Rutgers University involvement**: Led by **Kelly Faller** as part of her **Master’s thesis**. Kelly conducted the data management, analysis, and report generation.
- The **USFWS Coastal Program** provided equipment, field time, project management, and other crucial support.

## Project Timeline
<ul class="timeline">
  <li><strong>2024</strong>: Initial deployments at Cattus Island and the Lighthouse Center. Recordings from late June to late September. Proof-of-concept year with collaboration building.</li>
  <li><strong>2025</strong>: Expanded monitoring during breeding season. Acoustic recorders deployed early June. <a href="https://www.tidalmarshbirds.org/index.php/publicly-availablr-products/products/vegatation-sampling-protocols/marsh-survey-protocols/221-sharp-callbacksurvey-protocol-2025/file">SHARP protocols</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>2026</strong>: Continued monitoring and data analysis. Restoration activities in early 2026; preliminary findings shared later.</li>
  <li><strong>2027</strong>: Continued data analysis and thesis defense alongside ongoing monitoring.</li>
  <li><strong>2028 and beyond</strong>: Ongoing post-restoration monitoring for success metrics.</li>
</ul>

## Explore the Results
The data used in these analyses were **downloaded using the backup feature on the Arbimon platform**, and all species presence data was derived from extensive pattern matching analyses in Arbimon.

## Why Open Source?
I hope that by sharing this code on GitHub, other researchers and practitioners can:

✅ Use these scripts as a starting point for their own projects.  
✅ Adapt the visualizations and metrics for different sites and monitoring goals.  
✅ Contribute improvements or adaptations to strengthen the community of practice.

If you’d like to support my work or adaptations, please visit the **“Sponsor this Project”** banner on the repository page!
