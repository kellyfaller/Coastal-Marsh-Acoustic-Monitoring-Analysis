# Coastal Marsh Acoustic Monitoring
### Research landing page for tracking acoustic monitoring efforts in coastal marshes along the Delaware and Barnegat Bays.

Welcome to my research landing page! This site highlights ongoing work to understand how birds respond to changes in marsh habitat, especially in the **Delaware and Barnegat Bays**. Here you‚Äôll find:

- Project goals and methods
- Analysis scripts and supporting materials
- Visuals and updates on this important work

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Evaluate how marsh restoration influences the acoustic environment.
- Provide a reproducible framework for analyzing **passive acoustic monitoring (PAM)** data in tidal wetland habitats.
- Make this analysis pipeline **open source** and adaptable for other bioacousticians and conservation scientists.

---

## Project Collaboration

This project was a **collaboration between the USFWS Coastal Program and Rutgers University**, with invaluable support from Danielle McCulloch (USFWS).

- **Rutgers University involvement**: Led by **Kelly Faller** as part of her **Master‚Äôs thesis**. Kelly conducted the data management, analysis, and report generation.
- The **USFWS Coastal Program** provided equipment, field time, project management, and other crucial support to make the acoustic monitoring of marsh restoration possible.

## Project Timeline

<ul class="timeline">
  <li><strong>2024</strong>: Initial deployments at Cattus Island and the Lighthouse Center. Recordings from late June to late September. Proof-of-concept year with collaboration building.</li>
  <li><strong>2025</strong>: Expanded monitoring. Acoustic recorders deployed early June to capture 1.5 months of the breeding season, as defined by the <a href="https://www.tidalmarshbirds.org/index.php/publicly-availablr-products/products/vegatation-sampling-protocols/marsh-survey-protocols/221-sharp-callbacksurvey-protocol-2025/file">SHARP protocols</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>2026</strong>: Continued monitoring and data analysis. Restoration activities scheduled for early 2026; preliminary findings to be shared later in the year.</li>
  <li><strong>2027</strong>: Continued data analysis and sharing results. Thesis defense and reporting alongside ongoing monitoring.</li>
  <li><strong>2028 and beyond</strong>: Ongoing post-restoration monitoring for success metrics.</li>
</ul>

## Explore the Results

The data used in these analysis scripts were **downloaded using the backup feature on the Arbimon platform**, and all species presence data was derived from extensive pattern matching analyses performed in Arbimon.

## Why Open Source?

I hope that by sharing this code on GitHub, other researchers and practitioners can:

‚úÖ Use these scripts as a starting point for their own projects.  
‚úÖ Adapt the visualizations and metrics for different sites and monitoring goals.  
‚úÖ Contribute improvements or adaptations to strengthen the community of practice.

If you‚Äôd like to support my work or adaptations, please visit the **‚ÄúSponsor this Project‚Äù** banner on the repository page!
