Welcome to my research landing page! This site highlights ongoing work to understand how birds respond to restoration in marsh habitat at two sites in the Barnegat Bay, **Cattus Island and the Lighthouse Center for Natural Resource Education**. On this page, you‚Äôll find information about:

- Project goals and methods
- Visuals and project updates
- Contact information for collaboration

Please visit my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kellyfaller/Coastal-Marsh-Acoustic-Monitoring-Analysis) for open-sourced code and tools to aid in your own research in bioacoustics.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Evaluate how marsh restoration influences the acoustic environment.
- Provide a reproducible framework for analyzing **passive acoustic monitoring (PAM)** data in tidal wetland habitats.
- Make this analysis pipeline **open source** and adaptable for other bioacousticians and conservation scientists.

---

## Project Collaboration
This project was a **collaboration between the USFWS Coastal Program and Rutgers University**, with invaluable support from Danielle McCulloch (USFWS).

- **Rutgers University involvement**: Led by **Kelly Faller** as part of her **Master‚Äôs thesis**. Kelly conducted the data management, analysis, and report generation.
- The **USFWS Coastal Program** provided equipment, field time, project management, and other crucial support.

## Project Timeline
<ul class="timeline">
  <li><strong>2024</strong>: Initial deployments at Cattus Island and the Lighthouse Center. Recordings from late June to late September. Proof-of-concept year with collaboration building.</li>
  <li><strong>2025</strong>: Expanded monitoring during breeding season. Acoustic recorders deployed early June. <a href="https://www.tidalmarshbirds.org/index.php/publicly-availablr-products/products/vegatation-sampling-protocols/marsh-survey-protocols/221-sharp-callbacksurvey-protocol-2025/file">SHARP protocols</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>2026</strong>: Continued monitoring and data analysis. Restoration activities in early 2026; preliminary findings shared later.</li>
  <li><strong>2027</strong>: Continued data analysis and thesis defense alongside ongoing monitoring.</li>
  <li><strong>2028 and beyond</strong>: Ongoing post-restoration monitoring for success metrics.</li>
</ul>

## Explore the Results
The data used in these analyses were **downloaded using the backup feature on the Arbimon platform**, and all species presence data was derived from extensive pattern matching analyses in Arbimon.

## Why Open Source?
I hope that by sharing this code on GitHub, other researchers and practitioners can:

‚úÖ Use these scripts as a starting point for their own projects.  
‚úÖ Adapt the visualizations and metrics for different sites and monitoring goals.  
‚úÖ Contribute improvements or adaptations to strengthen the community of practice.

If you‚Äôd like to support my work or adaptations, please visit the **‚ÄúSponsor this Project‚Äù** banner on the repository page!
