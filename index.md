Welcome to my research landing page! This site highlights ongoing work to understand how birds respond to marsh restoration at two sites in the Barnegat Bay, NJ, **Cattus Island and the Lighthouse Center for Natural Resource Education**. The primary way this project will be collecting data on birds is through *soundscape ecology*, or the study of acoustic relationships between living organisms and their environment. 

On this page, you‚Äôll find information about:

- Project goals and methods
- Audio and pictures of the study sites
- Data visuals and project updates
- Contact information for collaboration

Please visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kellyfaller/Coastal-Marsh-Acoustic-Monitoring-Analysis) for open-sourced code and tools to aid in your own research in soundscape ecology.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Evaluate how marsh restoration influences the acoustic environment.
- Provide a reproducible framework for analyzing **passive acoustic monitoring (PAM)** data in tidal wetland habitats.
- Make this analysis pipeline **open source** and adaptable for other acoustic ecologists, restoration practitioners, land managers, and conservation scientists.

## Methodology

*Coming soon*
<!-- Add methods here and links to the documentation -->
---

## Project Collaboration
This project is a **collaboration between the USFWS Coastal Program and Rutgers University**, with invaluable support from Danielle McCulloch, USFWS Coastal Program Biologist.

- **Rutgers University involvement** was led by **Kelly Faller** as part of her **Master‚Äôs thesis** in the [Graduate Program in Ecology and Evolution](https://ecoevo.rutgers.edu/), under the advisement of Dr. Richard (Rick) G. Lathrop, the Director of the [Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis (CRSSA)](https://crssa.rutgers.edu/). Kelly conducted fieldwork, data management, analysis, and report generation. 
- The **USFWS Coastal Program** involvement was led by **Danielle McCulloch**. USFWS provided equipment, field time, project management, and other crucial support. This project was designed by the USFWS and would simply *not* have happened without their efforts and continued support.

## Project Timeline
<ul class="timeline">
  <li><strong>2024</strong>: Initial deployments at Cattus Island and the Lighthouse Center. Field recordings were collected from late June through late September. Due to the limitations of recording period, this year is considered a proof-of-concept and collaboration-building year.</li>
  <li><strong>2025</strong>: Expanded monitoring during breeding season. Acoustic recorders were deployed in early June and will collect field data through late October, incorporating fall migration season. SHARP point count and call-back surveys were completed during the breeding season window as per the <a href="https://www.tidalmarshbirds.org/index.php/publicly-availablr-products/products/vegatation-sampling-protocols/marsh-survey-protocols/221-sharp-callbacksurvey-protocol-2025/file">SHARP protocols</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>2026</strong>: Continued monitoring and data analysis. Restoration activities planned for early 2026; preliminary findings will be shared with core partners.</li>
  <li><strong>2027</strong>: Continued data analysis and thesis defense alongside ongoing monitoring.</li>
  <li><strong>2028 and beyond</strong>: Ongoing post-restoration monitoring for adaptive management and an understanding of long-term marsh soundscape change.</li>
</ul>

## Explore the Marsh
<!-- Add info about the marsh/what it needs for restoration/what restoration is happening and why, audio samples, or field notes here -->

Want to know what a soundscape of the marsh sounds like? Below is an audio file recorded in a salt marsh along the Delaware Bay in early May 2023. The recording is from roughly 8 PM. What you'll experience is a typical spring dusk chorus. Birds exhibit heightened periods of singing activity at dawn and dusk. The reason why is actually something that science has not quite figured out yet. There are many hypotheses for why. You can hear more about that here: [The Field Guides Podcast: Ep. 73 The Dawn Chorus (Part 1)](https://www.thefieldguidespodcast.com/new-blog/2024/8/24/ep-67-fishers-in-the-field-a-hike-with-carnivore-researcher-dr-scott-lapoint-cjfme-5z8gz-em7y6-w4f4x)

## Explore the Results
The data used in these analyses were **downloaded using the backup feature on the Arbimon platform**, and all species presence data was derived from extensive pattern matching analyses in Arbimon.
